		<h4>Wanna see some magic?</h4>
		Momma’s got a brand-new grid.
		<h4>First, we’re here because of Jen and Rachel.</h4>
		They’re the original Grid Gurus.
		You could spend months reading everything they’ve written.
		How about browser support?
		http://caniuse.com/#search=CSS-grid
		Where to start?
		https://gridbyexample.com/
		I started here, then
		… forked Rachel’s Pens
		https://codepen.io/collection/nmRZRo/
		and played with each one, until I understood what each thing does.

		Resources from Jen.
		Mozilla
		Talks
		So. Grid.
		Big subject.
		Been a long time coming.
		What is it?
		Where do we use it?
		Does it work with Flexbox?
		Where do we start?
		What is it?
		Here’s what it’s not:
		A plugin
		A framework
		A page-builder
		A panacea (much)
		When do we use it?
		(Does it work with Flexbox?)
		Story: learning Flexbox, building a theme with it
		So now we can use Grid to make grids
		Archive pages
		Blog pages
		Product pages
		Thanks, grid frameworks. You taught me some great php.
		Photo galleries
		Tile and card layouts
		And more.
		And Flexbox to line up boxes.
		Navigation
		Rows/columns of widgets
		Single posts
		On a single post template
		Inside a widget, or a card


		What’s this about magic?
		Story: conv w/AVP
		So anytime Flexbox or Grid keep things lined up and evenly spaced, without me doing a bunch of calculations, that feels like magic - to me, anyway.
